#  The Cherry Family 

Combining our proprietary annotation tools with image recongition algorithms, we at Real Estate Technologies are developing and expanding a family of tools and softwares to advance the multitude of real estate activities. The Cherry Family "cherry picks" all the details and features in a home, apartment, or any other architectural structure. 

### Cherry Search Engine - Why Settle? 

Searching for a home should be fun and exciting; the basic way homebuyers currently search (square footage, number of beds/baths, etc.) is no longer going to cut it. The Cherry Search Engine allows homebuyers to search the vast variety of homes on the market by using images that best represent what they are looking for. Our surveys have shown that a homebuyer would pay over 10% of the asking price of a home that meets thier needs. Why waste the homebuyers time with homes that do not match their criteria? Why have a homebuyer settle on one of, if not, the biggest purchase they will ever make?
